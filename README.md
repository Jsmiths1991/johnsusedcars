# John's Used Cars

This is Group 9's project for COSC 3318-01: Data Base Management Systems. It is
based on [Professor Van Vung Pham's tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxyOsIbHSrxkAbUOm6C1CJyD-zIf5cbsO).

## Getting Started

This project is written in Java using the Netbeans IDE and assumes you followed
the instructions for the class on Blackboard. If you open it in Netbeans, all
you need to do is set up the database. To do that...

1. Run a SQL server in MAMP, making sure the MySQL port is set to 3306
2. Open MySQLWorkbench and connect to the server, which should be on
   localhost:3306
3. Run src/main/resources/juc.sql in MySQLWorkbench to create the database
